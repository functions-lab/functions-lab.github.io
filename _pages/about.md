I am an assistant professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.duke.edu/) (secondary appointment) at Duke University. I direct the 
<a href="https://functions-lab.github.io/lab/team"><img src="../assets/img/functionslab_logo_transparent.png" width="90"></a>,
working with a group of talented students on various topics cutting across the networking, communication, sensing, and energy-efficient computing aspects of wireless, mobile, optical, and quantum networked systems, and our projects span both the theoretical and experimental domains. I am also the co-founder and Network Lead of [WiLO Networks Inc.](https://www.wilonetworks.com/), a start-up focusing on low-power sensor hardware and end-to-end systems.

Before joining Duke in Fall 2021, I was a postdoc in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Yale University in 2020&ndash;2021, working with Prof. [Leandros Tassiulas](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/leandros-tassiulas) and Prof. [Lin Zhong](https://www.linzhong.org/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2020 (advisor: Prof. [Gil Zussman](https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/people/gil-zussman/)) and my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2014 (advisors: Prof. [Zhisheng Niu](https://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab/niu_zhisheng.php) and Prof. [Sheng Zhou](https://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/shengzhou/)).

**Interests**: I am interested in the broad areas of future wireless, mobile, optical, and quantum networks as well as intelligent IoT systems. My recent research focuses on both theoretical and experimental aspects of massive antenna systems and millimeter-wave networks, optical and quantum networks, and spectrum sharing systems, and their convergence with edge cloud, energy-efficient computing, and AI/ML. I also enjoy building efficient hardware-software systems and experimental testbeds at scale.

**Impacts**: My research has been recognized by two IBM Academic Awards (2023, 2021), a Google Research Scholar Award (2021), the Columbia Engineering Morton B. Friedman Memorial Prize for Excellence (2021), the Columbia University Eli Jury Award (2021), a Facebook Fellowship (2019), and a Wei Family Private Foundation (WFPF) Fellowship (2014). I have received multiple paper awards from IEEE/Optica OFC’24 (Top-Scored Paper), IEEE/Optica OFC’23 (Top-Scored Paper), ECOC’23 (Best Paper Award), ACM CoNEXT’16 (Best Paper Award), ACM MobiHoc’19 (Best Paper Finalist), and IEEE MTT-S IMS’19 (Advanced Practice Paper Finalist). My Ph.D. thesis received the ACM SIGMOBILE Dissertation Award Runner-up. WiLO Networks Inc. is currently supported by NSF SBIR Phase I (TI-2108012) and Phase II (TI-2345381) awards.
