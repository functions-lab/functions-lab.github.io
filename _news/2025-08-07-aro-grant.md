Received a grant from ARO (Co-PI: [Prof. Dirk Englund](https://www.rle.mit.edu/people/dirk-englund/)) to work on enabling machine intelligence on wireless networks (MIWEN) via ultra-low-power in-physics computing using RF signals and electronics. This is based on our recent work on enabling in-physics computing for deep learning directly at radio frequency, with proof-of-concept results demonstrated in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17752).
