Our paper on disaggregated deep learning using in-physics computing directly at RF was accepted to [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/journal/sciadv). In this paper, we introduced and demonstrated a wireless edge inference architecture that enables disaggregates model access by broadcasting ML model weights over the air and performs complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at the edge devices in the RF domain. This series of work is in collboration with [Prof. Dirk Englund](https://qp.mit.edu/)'s group at MIT. We will also present this work at the [Workshop on AI and ML for Next-Generation Wireless Communications and Networking (AI4NextG)](https://ai4nextg.github.io/) at [NeruIPS 2025](https://neurips.cc/).
