Together with [Dan Kilper](https://connectcentre.ie/people/dan-kilper/) and [Camille Delezoide](https://www.nokia.com/people/camille-delezoide/), we are excited to launch the [Inaugural Dataset Paper Submission](https://www.ofcconference.org/submit-a-paper/dataset-submission) at [OFC 2026](https://www.ofcconference.org/), which aims to solicit dataset papers and to establish a collaborative platform for researchers, scholars, and practitioners from academia and industry to develop, evaluate, and showcase ML techniques applied to diverse datasets collected from real-world optical devices, platforms, and networks. Please consider submitting your dataset papers!
