Received a grant from Duke Engineering's [Beyond the Horizon Initiative](https://pratt.duke.edu/impact/pre-research/) to develop a dark fiber network for hybrid quantum-classical experimental research. This is a collaborative project with the [Duke Quantum Center (DQC)](https://quantum.duke.edu/) and [Duke Office of Information Technology (OIT)](https://oit.duke.edu/).
